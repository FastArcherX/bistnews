3. Save the downloaded file somewhere safe
4. To restore: "Import" the saved file

## Troubleshooting

### System Won't Start
```bash
# Try this first
setup-modules.bat

# If that doesn't work, check if Node.js is installed
node --version
# Should show version number like "v18.x.x"
```

### Can't Access Website
- Make sure both console windows are open and running
- Try: http://localhost:8080 or http://127.0.0.1:8080
- Check if Windows Firewall is blocking the connection

### Images Not Loading
- Images are stored in: `server-data/uploads/`
- Make sure the folder exists and isn't read-only
- Try restarting the system

### Real-time Updates Not Working
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Make sure backend server is running (port 3001)
- Try refreshing the page

### Reset Everything
```bash
# This deletes all articles and starts fresh
rmdir /s server-data
setup-modules.bat
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Change Admin Password
Edit file: `dist/enhanced-database.js` around line 46
```javascript
password: "your-new-password-here"
```

### Change Ports
- **Frontend**: Edit `avvia-sito.bat`, change `8080` to your preferred port
- **Backend**: Edit `server.js`, change `3001` to your preferred port

### Network Access
By default, only the local computer can access the system. To allow access from other computers on your network:
1. Edit `avvia-sito.bat`
2. Change `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`
3. Access via: `http://[computer-ip]:8080`
